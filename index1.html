               <!-- 6 MARCH 2023 -->

               <!-- table>(tr>td*3) -->

               HTML  TABLE
               <!-- it is collection of rows and coulumn
               table is grid organised in rows and coloumn
               to create table in html we have table tag <table></table>
               the table we want to create we have to write within table tag
               here we are creating table row by rowsto create table row we have tr tag
               * to create cells in html we have two tags
               1. th tag - it is used to create coloumn heading cells
               2. td tag - it is used to create data cells
               to provide title or cption to the table we have caption tag <caption>EMPLOYE</caption>
               the title of the table we have write within caption tag
               caption tag we have write within table tag -->


               <!-- // ROWSPAN AND COLSPAN -->

               <!-- CELL SPANNING , span = extend

               ROWSPAN
                in html we have two ways to span the cells
               1. row span = Rowspan = "No of cell span" -> value in digits
               2. It is an attribute used to span the cells on row basis 

               COLSPAN
               1. Colspan is an attribute used to span the cell on coloumn basis
               *note - Rowspan and colspan attribute we can only used with th and td tag
                     - we can together use rowspan and colspan attribute

                     ATTRIBUTES OF TABLE TAG

                1. Cell spacing
                - the space around the cell is know as cellspacing (cellspacing= "value" -> digit)
                2. Cell padding 
                - the space between cell border and cell content is know as cell padding  (cellpadding = "value" -> digit) -->


                <!-- thead tag - it represent top most part of our table 
                the coloumn heading we hav eto write within thead tag

                tbody - remaiing content our table we have write within tbody tag

                tfoot tag - it represents bottom most part of our table 
                the conclusion or summary we have write within tfoot tag
         
                note - thead,tbody,tfoot - highly recommended to use inside table, for better explanation and crawler understanding purpose -->
